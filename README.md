# GUNBIRD
We're going to replicate the 1994 Gunbird game arcade version developed and published by Psyko as a tribute to the game. This project has been done by four catalan students of CITM - UPC (Terrasa, Spain). 

## ABOUT THE GA

It was released in 1994 for arcades and belongs to the vertically scrolling shoot'em up genre and has both single-player and two-player cooperative modes.
  






Here you'll find all the information and sprites we've gathered in order to make the game.
